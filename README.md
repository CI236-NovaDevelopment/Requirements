3.2 Requirements and design

3.2.1 A document detailing the requirements for the new system. This will include

specified by him/her.

3.2.2 A use case model for the requirements of the calendar by using a UML tool.

3.2.3 Detailed system use case descriptions, by using the use case template
provided. Each team member will be responsible for at least one use case
description.

responsible for at least one user scenario and the design of a screen
fulfills the user scenarios.

3.2.5 Define a conceptual model by using a class diagram.

3.2.6 Design an Entity-Relationship diagram.

3.2.7 Build a database for the calendar. You should build only one database for the
group.

3.2.8 Design a high level architecture that includes the main components of your
system and how they are interconnected.

3.2.9 Apply the Model View Controller pattern to the calendar system. Show how
each component of the pattern is specialized for the calendar. Explain how
this pattern is useful and how non-functional requirements are achieved by
using this pattern.
  c. If any detail from the System Outline is unclear and you have been unable to clarify it
  during your interviews, you may need to make some assumptions. These
  assumptions should conform to reasonable practice and should be clearly stated.
  Marks will be deducted if any of your work is unclear.
